## Nesting and Indentation
Indentation is used purely to make the code more readable

Nesting is used in order to make elements inside elements such as lists

## Anchor Elements
- <a href="../README.md">Home</a>

href is the URL of where the tag should go to

Href is a HTML attribute however it is reserved to < a>, meanwhile there is global attributes such as draggable which allows all content in a tag to be draggable

## Image Elements
- <img src="" alt="">

The src and alt is an HTML attribute just like href and draggable it is reserved to img and other tags.

src takes the URL of the image
alt takes a text where people using screen reader can know what the image is about, or simply if the image never loaded you can know what the image is supposed to be.
