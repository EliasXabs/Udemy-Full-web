The more used units are em and rem, 1 em is 100% of the parent tag, rem is 100% of the root tag basically the HTML tag

Some people use the named sizes such as xx-large however it is not recommended

To determine the weight you can simply use a 0-100 number, or lighter/bolder which will be relative to the parent
