# Multi-page Websites
## File paths
File paths is a detailed location on the computer for example go to your documents then folder1 then into the desired file.

### Absolute File path
It starts from the root of the drive
- C:/Documents/Projects/Web/index.html

### Relative File path
A Relative file path is relative to the path of the code running
- ./ starting here
- ../ 1 folder behind
## Webpages
Webpages are HTML files but to reach each page you have to go to it using anchor tags that will take you to another page using the file path of the new page

## HTML boilerplate
This is how it looks like

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang ="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>My Website</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

- The doctype tells the browser which version of HTML file is written in

- HTML element is the opening and closing tag of all websites, the lang attribute is used for meta data and people who cant see the websites such as screen readers

- The head tag is the information that are not visible such as data about the characters used (charset) or the webpage title, viewport, compatible browsers...

- The body tag is everything that is visible on the website
