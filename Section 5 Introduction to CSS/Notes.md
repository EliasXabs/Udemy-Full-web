# Introduction to CSS
## Why do we need CSS
CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheet

Cascade means when it starts somewhere and keep adding on to it such as a multi layered waterfall

Style sheet is a type of language such as markup language and others

Without CSS all websites would look the same.

## How to add CSS
Three ways to add CSS:
- Inline < tag style="css">
- Internal < style>css</ style>
- External < link href="style.css"/>

The Inline is used to add css for a single tag

The Internal is used to apply styling for html document however never u sed

The External is used to apply styles to multi-page websites most common method

## CSS Selectors

The CSS selector is used to tell where the styling should apply

### Types of CSS selectors:
- Element Selector h1{color: blue}
- Class Selector .classname{color: red} the html element must have a class name < h1 class="classname">Red</ h1>
- ID Selector #idname{color: green} the html element must have an ID < h1 id="idname">
- Attribute Selector p[attribute]{color: yellow} only elements with the attribute will be styled
- Universal Selector *{color: purple} Selects all elements

### ID vs Class

The ID is unique per HTML page, unlike classes which can be repeated as many times on as my tags
